Note: this work was indeed done on 1-15-2021, but I didn't get around to posting it on the blog or tweeting it. Today started Pluralsight's "Python Core: Getting started" class in their "Python Core" path.  I tested out pretty well in their "Skill IQ" testing.  My result was "167 Proficient."  Just hoping to fill in any gaps still as I spend most of January covering Python basics.  At work, I am still doing pyvomomi efforts.
