This morning I went over [debugging in VS Studio Code][debugging].  I figure it is time for me to quit peppering 'print()' statements everywhere and start using the debugger.  From there I went into the [VS Code Django tutorial][vscode_dj] which also has debugging features in it.  Code Snippets in VS Code look interesting and I should investigate them further.
