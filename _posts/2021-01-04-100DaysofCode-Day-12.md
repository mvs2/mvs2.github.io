More Django in the [Python Crash Course][python-crash-course] book.  Template inheritance, DB queries using Django's ORM, and looping with Django's templating engine.  Also learned that a vertical line (what I would call a 'pipe' in linux or PowerShell) acts a "filter" which modifies the variable preceeding it.
