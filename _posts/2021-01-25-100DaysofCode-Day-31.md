Today I worked on my Mt. Bachelor parking reservations app.  I'll explain more about the app later, but it uses the [Arrive API][arrive] to creating parking reservations at Mt. Bachelor.  These reservations are a new requirment this season.  I've made quite a bit of progress on the application today.  The application queries for the date I want, and if it is available then books the date.  The booking is then sent to the ParkWhiz app, which is the app that Mt. Bachelor uses for their reservations.  Parkwhiz happens to be an Arrive API partner, it seems. 

The application then uses Twilio to send a text message to my phone to let me know the reservation is booked.  I have some clean up to do before posting the code, but most of the work is done, which is nice.
