More Django in the [Python Crash Course][python-crash-course] book.  Starting on user accounts and permissions (in this case permissions to edit topics).

Unrelated to coding per se, also dedicted to turn on VIM mode in VS Code to see if this can help me practicing my VIM skills (comes in handy with all of the linux VMs and ESXi interactions).
