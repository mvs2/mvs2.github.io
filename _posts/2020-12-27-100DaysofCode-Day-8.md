Today finished up the review of  ["Python Crash Course"][python-crash-course] instructional material (aka, the first half).  The second half of the book is projects, and so because of the Django interest, continued with the Django project contained within the book. 

Concepts today included more on testing, this time how to test classes.  Within the Django project, covered basic Models, migrations, the admin site and how to use it.  Also briefly touched on the Django shell and using the shell to inspect your models. 

Also solved a [py.checkio.org][pycheckio] exercise that dealt with strings.
