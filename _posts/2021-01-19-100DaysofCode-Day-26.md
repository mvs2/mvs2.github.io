Pluralsight course today is covering classes. Something these intructors did I have not seen before is using an underscore when declaring their class variables:

```python
class MyClass:
  # skip initializer for this example
   
   self._variable = variable
```
As opposed to what I normally see and use:
```python
class Myclass:
  # skip intializer for this example.
  self.variable = variable
```

The instructor said this is a widely used convention, which is strange to me since I have not seen it often in beginner tutorials or in browsing GitHub.  But maybe I wasn't paying attention enough or am just not experienced enough in advanced Python to notice.  I'll definitely keep it in mind in the future as I browser other's code.

Then, typical so far of this course, the example gets overly complicated for something that was supposed to be teaching clases and how they work.  And rushed.  I'm not going to rate this course very highly nor will I recommend it to others.  I think the topics covered are worthy topics, but the rush and the leaning on things that many might not already know is too much.
