Today was more of [Michael Kennedy's][talk-python] course.  Concepts covered included json, calling apis, using get() with dictionaries so if a key doesn't exist you don't get key error. 

Today he used something I called "nested gets()"
My own example:
```python
>>> my_dict = {'menu' : {'breakfast':'oatmeal', 'lunch': 'Pad Thai', 'dinner':'Pizza'}}
>>> my_dict.get('menu')
{'breakfast': 'oatmeal', 'lunch': 'Pad Thai', 'dinner': 'Pizza'}
>>> my_dict.get('menu').get('dinner')
'Pizza'
```
It makes perfect sense but is something I had not considered before.

Also covered HTTP response codes, and once again more use of nested tuples.
