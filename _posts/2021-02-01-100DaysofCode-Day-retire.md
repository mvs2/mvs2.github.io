Well, this is it.  Had a very different weekend than normal, so missed the entire weekend.  I think at this point, given the other missed days as well, its time for me to retire from the strictness of 100 days of code.  I'm still going to keep going, but basically will call it my own "hour of code."  I'll increment the days on it when I perform a day.  I'll make short blog entries as well to keep track of progress.  And I intend to start sharing more "full" code that I've written given time.  But there are going to be "blanks" or days where I don't get to things outside of work and family.  I still intend to fully have more days in 2021 where I wrote code than days I did not.

Today I did some work on "MITx 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python" via [edX][edX].
