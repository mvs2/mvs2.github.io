Still more Django in the [Python Crash Course][python-crash-course] book.  I'm both following along and typing in the author's examples, and then doing the exercises.  Some of the exercises are taking me longer than it feels like they should, so the hour runs by quickly.  But hopefully that means the learning is sticking.  Most of the work was in creating new view funcions, links, and templates/html pages.
