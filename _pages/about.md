Just me, Marcus.  Husband, Father of two, work in virtualization with an emphasis on automation (not sure if I get to call it 'DevOps' yet or not).  When not working and playing with tech, I enjoy exploring Bend, Oregon and doing as many outdoor activities as I can find time to enjoy. Happy to be here.
