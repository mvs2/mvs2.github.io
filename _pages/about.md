Just me, Marcus.  Husband, Father of two, work in virtualization with an emphasis on automation (some call that DevOps).  When not working and playing with tech, I enjoy exploring Bend, Oregon and doing as many outdoor activities as I can find time to enjoy. Happy to be here. You can email me at marcus@virtualmarcus.com
